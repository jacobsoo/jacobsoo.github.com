        <h3>Welcome to my new blog.</h3>

<p>I hope to make this blog dedicated to exploring, exploiting, improving &amp; reversing some of the tasks i'm facing daily.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/DomainWhoisHistory">DomainWhoisHistory</a> - Retrieve Domain Whois history on domain names of your choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/DailyChangesExporter">DailyChangesExporter</a> - DomainControlExporter (DCE) is just a tool downloads the activites hosted at at the nameserver domaincontrol.com 
It is an attempt to check what are the newly registered domains and possibly unmasking new domain(s) belonging to ExploitKit or Botnet. 
This makes it easier to search for specific weird domain names that is not always easily surfaced by using Google.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/DateDecoder">DateDecoder</a> - DateDecoder is a tool that helps you decode or verify dates that forensics tools returned.
This tool was developed when i have too many date/time to decode during work and CTF. This is developed entirely out of fun and for practising my C# development.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/longurl">longurl</a> longurl produces the actual url for most shortened url(s).
longurl is just a tool that i used frequently to check all those shortened url(s) that i've received from work, emails and other places. 
It is an attempt to check whether the shortened url(s) contained any malicious stuff and possibly unmasking new malicious malware.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/GrabIPFromPcap">GrabIPFromPcap</a> - This is a simple script that i've used quite often at work to extract out IPs from Pcap(s). 
I do hope that this will prove somewhat useful to some of you if not all of you.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/FindDuplicates">FindDuplicates</a> - This is a short and simple Python script that i use to find out whether there are duplicates in 2 different files. 
I do hope that this will prove somewhat useful to some of you if not all of you.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/HexBytes2Bin">HexBytes2Bin</a> - This is a simple script that i uses to create binary file(s) from hex bytes. 
The hex bytes are usually what i've gotten from some malicious malware or from ExploitKit. 
I need to convert it to binary files so that it's easier for me to analyse it. 
I do hope that this will prove somewhat useful to some of you if not all of you.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/ErrorCodes">ErrorCodes</a> - This is just a simple application that i've used to check the error codes when i am developing other projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/Kronos">Kronos - This application enables users to change the TimeStamp for Date Created, Date Modified and Date Accessed for any File or Folder. 
Although this application is designed to frustrate simple forensic analysis, it should be noted that its use can be easily detected.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/SpecialFoldersView">SpecialFoldersView</a> - Microsoft Windows OSes have quite a number of special folders that are used for storing application settings and files, storing Internet files, saving temporary files, storing shortcuts to other files, and so on. 
This utility displays the list of all special folders in your system.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/ImageSignature">ImageSignature</a> - An image signature that shows user(s)' information. I did this 10 years ago when i was trying out how to gather information of a user and showing it as an image. 
Thus, this application wasn't updated until recently when i was trying to see the results i have on mobile users. I hope that i will continue updating this application to include many other mobile OS.
</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/OperaBookMarkExtractor">OperaBookMarkExtractor</a> - This simple application is something that i've developed to extract all the bookmarks from Opera Browser on a machine.
This is part of my personal Forensics Framework. 
I hope that it'll be useful to some of you if not all of you.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacobsoo/GoogleProfileCrawler">GoogleProfileCrawler</a> - This application simply grab all the Google+ Profile url(s).</p>

<p>Please feel free to email me if there are any queries. :D</p>
